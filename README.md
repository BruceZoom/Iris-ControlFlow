# Iris-ControlFlow
The repository for the project Iris with ControlFlow.

## Source Code

The `theories` folder is the source code of our Coq formalization.

- **lang.v** defines the programming language with control flow statements and proves relative properties.
- **notation.v** defines notations and syntax sugars for the programming language.
- **multi_post.v** defines our weakest precondition with multiple post-conditions and proves some useful proof rules of it.

## Documentation

The `docs` folder gives documentations of our formalization.

There is only a draft of our documentation, and we are still working on a more detailed version.
